Seal the Deal: A Guide to Affordable Notary Services for Operation Restoring Valor
==================================================================================

**By Dr. Correo Hofstad - USAF** *Founder, Operation Restoring Valor*

When you are fighting to dismiss a case or expunge a non-conviction record, the paperwork is your weapon. Affidavits, sworn statements, and motions often require a **notary seal** to be legally valid. While this stamp is just a formality, it is a mandatory one.

You should not have to pay a premium to prove your innocence. Below is a tactical guide to finding free or low-cost notary services, ranked from "Mission Essential" (Free) to "Convenience" (Paid).

**Tier 1: The "Home Base" Option (Free for Service Members)**
-------------------------------------------------------------

For active duty, reservists, and often retirees, your first stop should always be within the military ecosystem. These services are not just free; they understand the specific nature of military legal matters.

-   **Military Legal Assistance Offices (JAG):**

    -   **Cost:** **$0.00**

    -   **Who is eligible:** Active duty, Guard/Reserve (on orders), retirees, and dependents.

    -   **Why use them:** Under **10 U.S.C. § 1044a**, Judge Advocates and certain civilian legal staff are federally authorized notaries. Their seal is valid internationally and requires no state-specific stamp.

    -   **Action:** Visit your local installation's Legal Assistance Office (SJA). Walk-ins are often accepted for notary acts.

-   **Unit Adjutants & Commanders:**

    -   **Cost:** **$0.00**

    -   **Who is eligible:** Unit members.

    -   **Why use them:** For military-specific documents, commissioned officers in the grade of O-4 and above, as well as adjutants, have statutory notary authority under Article 136 of the UCMJ.

**Tier 2: The "Financial Ally" Option (Free for Customers)**
------------------------------------------------------------

If you cannot get to base, check your wallet. The bank cards you carry often grant you access to complimentary notary services.

-   **Major Banks (Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank):**

    -   **Cost:** **$0.00** (typically)

    -   **Condition:** You usually must be an account holder. Chase, for example, provides notary services for free to anyone with a checking, savings, or even just a credit card account.

    -   **Action:** Call your local branch to confirm a notary is on duty. Do not just show up; notaries have shifts.

-   **Credit Unions (Navy Federal, USAA, Local CUs):**

    -   **Cost:** **$0.00**

    -   **Condition:** Membership required.

    -   **Why use them:** Credit unions are often more community-focused and willing to help veterans with paperwork even if policies are strict at big banks. Note that USAA acts digitally, so physical notary services are limited to their few physical locations, but they often reimburse or partner for these services.

**Tier 3: The "Community" Option (Low Cost / Free)**
----------------------------------------------------

Your local tax dollars support institutions that often provide this service to the public.

-   **Public Libraries:**

    -   **Cost:** **Free** or nominal fee (e.g., $1.00 per stamp).

    -   **Why use them:** Libraries are accessible and neutral. Many public libraries, such as the Kansas City Public Library and St. Paul Public Library, offer this as a community service.

    -   **Action:** Search "[City Name] Public Library Notary" to check availability.

-   **AAA (American Automobile Association):**

    -   **Cost:** **Free** for Premier members; discounted ($5-$10) for Basic/Plus members.

    -   **Condition:** Must be a member.

    -   **Why use them:** If you already pay for roadside assistance, use the perks. Most AAA branch offices have notaries on staff.

-   **City/County Clerk Offices:**

    -   **Cost:** Varies (often capped by state law).

    -   **Why use them:** If you are already at the courthouse filing your motion to dismiss, the Clerk of Court may have a notary available to finalize your signature on the spot.

**Tier 4: The "Retail" Option (Convenience Fee)**
-------------------------------------------------

If you are in a rush and need it done *now*, retail shipping centers are reliable, though they charge a fee.

-   **The UPS Store:**

    -   **Cost:** Generally **$5.00 to $15.00** per signature.

    -   **Note:** Prices vary by location because these are franchises. State laws often cap notary fees (e.g., $10 max per signature in many states), but stores may add "clerical fees."

    -   **Tip:** Call ahead. Not all employees are notaries.

-   **FedEx Office:**

    -   **Status:** Most FedEx Office locations do **not** offer in-person notary services anymore. They have partnered with **Notarize** for online services (see below).

**Tier 5: The "Digital" Option (Remote)**
-----------------------------------------

If you are deployed, housebound, or operating in a remote area (Domestic Deployment), you can use a Remote Online Notary (RON).

-   **Online Platforms (Notarize.com, OneNotary, PandaDoc):**

    -   **Cost:** Approximately **$25.00** for the first document + $10 for additional seals.

    -   **How it works:** You upload your PDF, connect via webcam, verify your ID (using a driver's license or passport), and sign digitally.

    -   **Validity:** Most states now recognize RON stamps, especially for federal matters, but **always verify** that the court accepting your expungement petition accepts electronic notarization.

**Pre-Mission Checklist: Before You Go**
----------------------------------------

To ensure your mission isn't scrubbed at the counter, follow these Rules of Engagement:

1.  **DO NOT SIGN** the document beforehand. You must sign in front of the notary. If you sign it at home, they will make you print a new one.

2.  **Bring Valid ID:** A government-issued photo ID (Military ID, Driver's License, Passport). It must be current.

3.  **Complete the Form:** Fill in all blanks *except* the signature line. Notaries cannot advise you on how to fill out the form (that's "practicing law").

4.  **Bring a Witness (If required):** Some documents require witnesses *in addition* to the notary. The notary usually cannot be a witness.

**Operation Restoring Valor** is about removing barriers. Don't let a $10 stamp stand between you and your clean record. Use your military benefits or banking relationships to get this done for free.
